The template for this project was adapted from the following links: 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w25ea_I89iM
    https://github.com/bradtraversy/python_feedback_app/blob/master/templates/index.html

These two links were used as the foundation for the webapp. Some chunks of code were directly sourced 
from the GitHub repository, but the overall project had to be modified for our groups needs.
